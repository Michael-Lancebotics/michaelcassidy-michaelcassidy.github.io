# Michael Cassidy Website

This is the source for my personal website, hosted on GitHub Pages and mapped to michaelcassidy.ca.

## How to deploy
1. Push the contents of the `site` folder to a GitHub repository (e.g., `michaelcassidy/michaelcassidy.github.io`).
2. Enable GitHub Pages in repository settings, set the source to the `main` branch and `/site` folder.
3. Add a custom domain (michaelcassidy.ca) in the GitHub Pages settings.
4. Update DNS records in GoDaddy to point to GitHub Pages.
